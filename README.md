*--- Student Management System in C++ ---*
#Overview
The Student Management System is a console-based application built in C++ that allows users to manage a list of students, their academic performance, and results. It uses a linked list data structure to dynamically store and manipulate student records.

#Features
Create List: Initialize a list of student records.
Insert Student: Add a new student to the list, including their marks for three subjects.
Delete Student: Remove a student's record by their name.
Modify Record: Update marks for a specific student by roll number.
Display Record: View details of a specific student using their roll number.
Display All Records: Show details of all students.
Display Results: Summarize the class performance based on divisions (First, Second, Third, and Fail).
Graceful Exit: End the program safely.

#Code Structure
main.cpp: Contains the main function with the program menu and user interaction.
List.h: Header file defining the Student structure and the StudentList class.
List.cpp: Implementation of all the methods in the StudentList class, including linked list operations.

#Concepts Demonstrated
Dynamic Memory Management
Linked List Implementation
Object-Oriented Programming
Menu-Driven Program Design
Data Analysis (Divisions based on marks)
